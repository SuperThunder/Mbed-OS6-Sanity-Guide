# Libraries
A reference of libraries available for various sensors / peripherals.

Keep in mind if the library was made for mbed 2 (highly incompatible with OS 5/6) vs mbed os 5 (relatively compatible, changes potentially needed for OS 6) vs mbed os 6 (likely only for libraries made since 2020).


##### Where to find libraries
- Search on https://os.mbed.com/code/
- Go on github.com and search for "mbed <device name>, eg "mbed MPU6050" or "mbed debounce"
